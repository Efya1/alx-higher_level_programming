0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

Resources Read or watch:

Object Oriented Programming (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded)) Object-Oriented Programming (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The init Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “str- and repr-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”) Class and Instance Attributes classmethods and staticmethods Properties vs. Getters and Setters (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”) str vs repr

Learning Objectives At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General Why Python programming is awesome What is OOP “first-class everything” What is a class What is an object and an instance What is the difference between a class and an object or instance What is an attribute What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes What is self What is a method What is the special init method and how to use it What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding What is a property What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python What are the special str and repr methods and how to use them What is the difference between str and repr What is a class attribute What is the difference between a object attribute and a class attribute What is a class method What is a static method How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class How to bind attributes to object and classes What is and what does contain dict of a class and of an instance of a class How does Python find the attributes of an object or class How to use the getattr function Copyright - Plagiarism You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
